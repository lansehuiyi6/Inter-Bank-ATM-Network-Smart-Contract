# Inter-Bank-ATM-Network-Smart-Contract
Using a blockchain with all the members of the network on the blockchain as nodes can help to decomplexify the whole system. The transactions done on the ATM can be recorded on the blockchain and smart contract can work between the issuer and acquirer bank directly without involving the mediator. This will help to enhance security, transparency and immutability of the data as there will be no loss of online transactions data. The reconciliation process will also be simplified because of implementation of the blockchain. This will reduce the transaction charges and the costs of reconciliation.
