# Inter-Bank-ATM-Network-Smart-Contract
Currently, Inter-Bank ATM process works as a Remote-On-Us model where third party network or mediator operates in between banks to transfer funds from one to another and charges fees for this which is further charged to customer only.
Using a blockchain with all the members of the network on the blockchain as nodes can help to decomplexify the whole system. The transactions done on the ATM can be recorded on the blockchain and smart contract can work between the issuer and acquirer bank directly without involving the mediator. This will help to enhance security, transparency and immutability of the data as there will be no loss of online transactions data. The reconciliation process will also be simplified because of implementation of the blockchain. This will reduce the transaction charges and the costs of reconciliation.

Suppose, there is a person XYZ who has a savings account with bank A, wants to withdraw the money from bank B's ATM. Bank A will debit the transaction value and charge from XYZ's account and will credit it to their settlement account. Bank C (mediator) will debit the Bank A's settlement account with transaction value and accumulated fee and will credit it accordingly to the Bank B's settlement account.

When a blockchain is implemented in Inter-Bank ATM network, Bank A will directly send money to Bank B without involving the Bank C(mediator).
